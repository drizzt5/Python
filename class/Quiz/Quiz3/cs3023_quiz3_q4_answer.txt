A. I think it is going to have a length of 10. If there is no __str__ method defined, it would just throw the
memory location of the object 10 times.



B. I believe that this does raise an AssertionError. We Assert that r1 and r2 occupants are not the same.
However, when we did the r2 = r1 statement we pointed them to the same object. Then we changed the occupant of
the object to Keith Richards. So I believe that the object has the same occupant now, and therefore doesn't raise an
error.
